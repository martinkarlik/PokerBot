A poker game with GUI, a project written in Pascal using a rather slow GUI library 'graph'. 
Reasons for using the Pascal language and the 'graph' library were merely to fullfill the given requirements, 
as this was only a high school project. The poker game is a texas hold'em heads-up (1v1) battle against a computer, 
who understand the poker rules, as well as the strength of its hand and is able to correctly assess the situation 
at the poker table. This makes the bot is quite predictable and fairly easy to beat, however, occassionally it can also 
pull of a pretty insane, though usually illogical bluff.
